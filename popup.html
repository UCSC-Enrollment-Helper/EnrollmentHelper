            <h3>This class is undoubtedly a bio weed-out class very dense and easy to fall behind in.
                Tamkun has it down to a science though, well written but fast-paced lectures, 4 exams,
                 neither section nor lecture is mandatory but you won't pass if you dont at least go to lecture.
                 Hard class, great professor.
               </h3>
           <h3>Worst professory ever.
                Dude does not care about you as a person or what you're going through.
                 He is clear about grades but grades harshly.
                  My biggest issue is that he makes this class more about memorization instead of learning.
                   He doesn't even respond to emails. He also gives a lot of extra credit but its barely worth anything.
               </h3>
           <h3>While the class is very lecture heavy, I felt that if you regularly attended lecture and put time into studying
                the learning outcomes that were provided, the class was easy to do well in. John made topics clear through
                 demonstrations (by himself or students drawing things out for the whole class, or demonstrations with the TA's).

                 Your understanding of material may be better than hers as the material is not hard to grasp,
                  but she has to go back and correct what she teaches. For some reason disease gene problems

            <h3>Lecture was pretty much pointless, and the midterm and final were way harder than it should've been.
                 Would not recommend!

            <h3>What she teaches in the class does not come up in the tests, it's completely different.

            <h3>Guido is an amazing professor. He really cares about his students.
                  This quarter, he gave us a lot of extra points which it made my grade go up by a lot.
                   Although the 2 midterms and the final is 60% of your grade.
                   The class itself is a tough class so get ready to take a lot of information at once go!
                    to your TA office hours, it really helps a lot.
                </h3>
            <h3>Completely disregarded my personal circumstances and is not a professor that keeps his word.
                </h3>
            <h3>Guido genuinely cares about his students. He is such an amazing lecturer and is very passionate
                 about what he teaches. He tries to be there for his students in any way possible.
                  He gives homework and allows us to resubmit for points back after receiving feedback which is super helpful.
                   Would definitely take another class with him!
